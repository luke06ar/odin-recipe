Recipe Website project:
This is the time to test what I've learnt so far
It's not that much, but it's honest work.

In this first part of the project I will create the HTML backbone of
the recipe website trying to use every aspect, skill and element ab-
sorbed in this journey. 

In addition, I will be using this project to practice git and cli c-
ommands.
